# 🍽️ Restaurant Order Analytics Dashboard

This project visualizes restaurant order data using Power BI, helping stakeholders understand top-performing dishes, customer preferences, and peak meal times. Data was cleaned and preprocessed using Python (pandas), then imported into Power BI for interactive dashboard creation.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Identify best-selling dishes
- Track order trends by meal times (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)
- Analyze revenue by cuisine and restaurant
- Help restaurant managers plan inventory efficiently

## 📊 Features

- **Top Ordered Dishes:** Bar charts displaying the most frequently ordered items
- **Revenue by Cuisine:** Visual breakdown of earnings by food categories
- **Time-based Trends:** Patterns across breakfast, lunch, and dinner
- **Interactive Filters:** Day, customer type, and restaurant location

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI:** For dashboard development and DAX measures
- **Python (pandas):** For ETL and data cleaning
- **Excel:** Initial raw data structure
- **CSV/Excel Integration:** Cleaned data was exported for visualization

## 🧹 ETL & Data Cleaning

We used Python and pandas to clean and transform the dataset:
- Removed missing/null values
- Standardized dish names and cuisine types
- Categorized timestamps into meal periods
- Merged multiple data sources (Orders and Restaurant Info)

> 📁 Files:  
> `Orders.xlsx` – Raw order data  
> `Restaurants.xlsx` – Restaurant metadata  
> `Cleaned_Restaurant_Orders.csv` – Final cleaned dataset
